# WordPress Neilson CTA Block plugin

A WordPress plugin that adds a Gutenberg block for creating call to action content.

## Features

The Neilson CTA Block includes the following features:

- Three layout options (Horizontal, Vertical Wide and Vertical Narrow), with the potential for more to be added.
- The ability to add any combination of an image, header and body text in addition to the call to action button.
- Options for customizing the colors, spacing and borders of the entire block or individual block elements.
- Options for enabling and disabling any of the custom styling options, making it easy to override the block styles with your own custom CSS.

### Using this block

When selecting this block for use in the block editor, the header will automatically appear, and below the header there will be the option to add any number of blocks as collapsible content.

In the right sidebar (Inspector Controls), you'll find various controls for managing the block styles and attributes.

- CTA ID allows the assignment of a custom id to the main CTA element.
- CTA Layout allows the user to select the layout type for desktop display, and includes alignment options for the image, header, text, and button.
- CTA Block Spacings allows the user to define custom margin and padding values for the block. This is disabled by default, and must be toggled to the active state to be used.
- CTA Borders allows the user to define custom borders(width, color, border-radius) and a custom box-shadow for the block. This is disabled by default, and must be toggled to the active state to be used.
- CTA Text Options allows the user to toggle the display of the header, body text. Here you can also add custom padding around the text content.
- CTA Colors allows the user to apply custom text colors and background colors to the entire CTA block. This is disabled by default, and must be toggled to the active state to be used.
- CTA Image allows the user to upload an image or select one from the media library for use in the CTA Block.
- CTA Button offers the option to add a target link for the CTA action. This panel also offers various color, padding and border styling options for the button itself.
